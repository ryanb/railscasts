  <h1>About RailsCasts</h1>
  <p>RailsCasts is produced by Ryan Bates (<%= link_to "rbates", "http://twitter.com/rbates" %> on Twitter and <%= link_to "ryanb", "https://github.com/ryanb" %> on GitHub). A new episode will be released each Monday featuring tips and tricks with <a href="http://www.rubyonrails.com/">Ruby on Rails</a>. The screencasts are short and focus on one technique so you can quickly move on to applying it to your own project. The topics target the intermediate Rails developer, but beginners and experts will get something out of it as well.</p>

  <h2>ASCIIcasts</h2>
  <p>If you prefer text over video, please visit <%= link_to "ASCIIcasts", "http://asciicasts.com/" %> where Eifion Bedford has done a wonderful job of translating the majority of the episodes into textual form.</p>

  <h2>TextMate Theme</h2>
  <p>Do you like the TextMate theme used in these screencasts? It is custom made and based off of the theme by <a href="http://fluidsyntax.com/blog/articles/idlefingers-textmate-theme">idlefingers</a>. I am using the <a href="http://www.gnome.org/fonts/">Bitstream Vera Sans Mono</a> font.</p>
